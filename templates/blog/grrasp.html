<h2 class="sub-title">Geospatial Risk and Resilience Assessment Platform - Joint Research Center</h2>
<p>The Geospatial Risk and Resilience Assessment Platform uses geo-spatial technologies for the analysis of the data
    and the visualization of the output obtained from spatial analysis. The system can be deployed in various servers in
    different EU Member States each one performing different tasks or accommodate different data. </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Geospatial technologies have been long used for managing risks, disasters and
    evaluate the resilience of systems. The most famous example is undoubtedly <b>HAZUS</b>, the Federal Emergency
    Management Agency's developed in the United States of America.
    Hazus uses Geographic Information Systems technology to estimate physical, economic, and social impacts of disasters.
    It graphically illustrates the limits of identified high-risk locations due to earthquake, hurricane, and floods.
    Users can then visualize the spatial relationships between populations and other more permanently fixed geographic
    assets or resources for the specific hazard being modeled, a crucial function in the pre-disaster planning process.
    Hazus is used for mitigation and recovery as well as preparedness and response.
    Government planners, GIS specialists, and emergency managers use Hazus to determine losses and the most beneficial
    mitigation approaches to take to minimize them.

    </a>Hazus can be used in the assessment step in the mitigation planning process, which is the foundation for a
    community's long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses and break the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction,
    and repeated damage.
    Being ready will aid in recovery after a natural disaster.<br>

    <span lang="EN">It would be extremely useful to have a similar tool in Europe to be used at a continental scale but
        for its complexity and exhaustiveness it would entail substantial funding and years of development.
        We are in not in the position for even trying to replicate such a system nonetheless, we want to use the overall
        idea of Hazus and adapt it to a European environment for the specific task of risk management for critical
        infrastructures. </span><br><span lang="EN">Hazus is free but it relies on commercial software whilst the solution
    we envisage will be completely free and Open Source with no other requirement.</span><br><br>
    The OpenQuake platform under development at the Global Earthquake Model is an open collaborative platform for
    earthquake risk management. The most interesting and innovative feature of this solution is represented by the
    admixture of state-of-the-art science, global collaboration, transparency and openness in an initiative to calculate
    and communicate earthquake risk worldwide. One of the first steps towards this objective has been the open-source
    development and release of software for seismic hazard and risk assessment called the OpenQuake engine.
    <br><br>This software comprises a set of calculators capable of computing human or economic losses for a collection
    of assets, caused by a given scenario event, or by considering the probability of all possible events that might
    happen within a region within a certain time span. <br><br>Another example, has been developed to help communities
    better prepare for floods, earthquakes and tsunamis, a multi-country partnership launched this week a new hazard
    impact modeling tool, called the Indonesia scenario assessment for emergencies, or <a href="http://inasafe.org/">
    InaSAFE</a>. <br><br>Developed by Indonesia and Australia, together with the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster
    Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), InaSAFE aims to make villages, towns and cities in Indonesia more resilient to natural
    disasters.<br><br>The intention of InaSAFE is to make it really simple and easy to perform impact analysis.
    The question area provides a simple way to formulate what it is you want to find out?<br><br>All questions are
    formulated in the form:<br><br>If [hazard] how many [exposure] might [impact]?<br><br>
    For example:<br><br><br><strong>If there is a flood how many schools might be closed?</strong><br><br><br>
    In order to answer such questions, the InaSAFE developers have built a number of impact functions that cover scenarios
    such as flood, tsunami, volcanic ash fall and earthquake. <br><br>What we deem of great interest in InaSAFE is the
    innovative GIS based approach as it works within Quantum GIS, its openness, scalability and adaptability.
    This is a platform for sharing knowledge and connecting communities of experts to find novel ways to deal with
    risk management.<br><br>The InaSAFE project is committed to investing in free and open source software meaning that
    anyone can use and adapt these tools, and is actively supported by risk experts and software developers from the World
    Bank/GFDRR, AusAID/AIFDR, European Commission Joint Research Centre, Global Earthquake Model (GEM),
    UN-World Food Program/ITHACA, and OpenGeo to further develop the functionality offered by the open source
    SAFE platform upon which InaSAFE is based. This cooperative approach in using the SAFE platform will save agencies
    time and resources in developing a risk assessment methodology and hazard impact modeling tools.
    <br>Finally, RiskScape is a multi-hazard impact and risk assessment tool developed in partnership between GNS Science
    and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.<br><br>The RiskScape model provides a framework to
    calculate the risk of impact to assets from different types of natural hazards. Risk information can then inform
    decision making for a range of natural hazard management activities including land-use planning, emergency management,
    asset management and insurance.<br><br>For RiskScape to model risk from natural hazards, the generic risk model is
    structured into Hazard, Asset and Vulnerability modules. Each module contains information on a component of the risk
    calculation process: <br>the Hazard Module contains data on hazard exposure (e.g. earthquake shaking intensity)
    <br>the Asset Module contains data on asset types and attributes exposed to the hazard (e.g. residential building -
    timber, 1 story, age (pre 1960)) <br>the Vulnerability Module contains models on the consequences or impacts resulting
    from the hazard's exposure to assets (e.g. % building damage from shaking intensity X). <br><br>
    RiskScape is not GIS software but provides however basic GIS functionality and offers input-output processing so
    that results can be exported in a GIS compatible format.<br>IT infrastructure and software of the GIS Platform<br>
    <br>A GIS is a system of hardware and software used for storage, retrieval, mapping, and analysis of geographic data.
    Spatial features are stored in a coordinate system (latitude/longitude, state plane, UTM, etc.), which references a
    particular place on the earth. Descriptive attributes in tabular form are associated with spatial features.
    <br><br><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OWfDmrGjsFQ/VbCR5KHf81I/AAAAAAAABhs/em04Mb3rpzQ/s1600/image005.png">

    There are two major components of any GIS system, the graphical component and the database component.
    The graphical component deals with representation of real world infrastructures abstracted to punctual, linear and
    areal geometries. For example, a street or road can be graphically represented by a line and a power plant with a point.
    <br><br>The database component deals with the attributes connected to any graphical component and describing the component.
    For example width or numbers of lanes are two of the numerous attributes that can be linked to a road.
    <br><br>The GIS prepared for this specific project is served through a webGIS platform enabling the delivers of maps
    and analysis on the World Wide Web.
    <br><br>The webGIS interface aims to be “dashboard” capable of interacting with all the procedures involved in the
    risk management, from data management to the generation of topologies, from the interaction with mathematical
    analyses to the visualization of these analyses.<br><br>
    All the software used in the GIS Platform is Open Source using either a GPL (GNU General Public License),
    BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) or MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) licensing.
    <br><br>The GIS platform is composed of four modules as visible in Figure 3. <br><br>The “Data Management” and
    “Data Processing” modules respectively have the task of pre-processing data and then use those data for performing
    analyzes.<br><br>Data management entails an innumerable list of activities such as data validation and quality check,
    data conversion and any other process useful to obtain a complete compliance with the Inspire directive (2007/2/EC).
    <br><br>Data processing is the pivotal process for transforming “raw data” into meaningful and comprehensible
    information. In most cases this transformation is obtained using programming languages and software packages with
    strong mathematical and scientific analysis capabilities such as Matlab and Python.

    <br><br>· Static spatial data stored locally (e.g. same server hosting the platform)<br><br>·
    Static spatial data stored remotely(e.g. a different server from the one hosting the platform) and dynamic real
    time data (e.g. the data are provided by remote servers often but not always storing their geographical position)
    <br><br>The two type share many similarities but have a different degree of usability.<br><br>
    The locally stored data can be viewed, selected and edited (e.g. add new data or delete old ones) whilst the remotely stored data are subjected to the restrictions put in places by the data owner and administrators and are usable for visualization purposes, are in some cases selectable but cannot be edited.<br><br><a style="margin-bottom: 1em; float: left; clear: left; margin-right: 1em" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVOYGe4slf4/VbCR68-5JkI/AAAAAAAABiI/U6RtsL8oFp0/s1600/image009.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OVOYGe4slf4/VbCR68-5JkI/AAAAAAAABiI/U6RtsL8oFp0/s320/image009.jpg"></a>For some of the locally stored data is meaningless to provide the possibility to change the data (e.g. borders of the European countries) for this reason the tools provided for editing data are available only for network related datasets while all the rest of the dataset provided by the platform are changed or updated only by the administrator of the site.<br><br><br>Dynamic data are also not changeable and can have an even more strict usability policies and due to their special nature are in some cases are not spatially located and are presented as a list of events (see Figure 7).<br><br><br>They represent threats posed to the critical infrastructure such as earthquakes, flooded areas, adverse weather conditions, etc... <br><br>Remotely stored data are sometimes subject to failure or can be not reachable for limited or extended period of time due to problems in the remote servers. This unavailability does not affect the overall usability of the platform which can be on the other hand seriously limited because this data are in general used as the starting point of any further analysis.<br>Interface</p>

Natural Hazards (extreme geophysical and biological events) <br>2. Technological Hazards (major accidents) <br>3. Context hazards (global change)<br><br>In any case each classification system, however, presents some ambiguities in the subdivision of hazard in categories. Therefore, the hazards considered in the scenario builder are those that have a spatial component, geo-hazards, which have a short onset time and an extension defined geographical thus excluding all the changing long-term such as climate change or affecting areas very extended and not demarcated as the desertification of large parts of southern Europe.<br><br>Spatially, hazard is expressed as areas representing temporal probability or return period which is an estimate of the likelihood of an event, such as an earthquake, flood or a river discharge flow to occur.<br><br>The EU has in the past commissioned and funded many projects that had as its primary objective the creations of risk maps for different hazards and different return period. Additionally, each member state has developed methodologies of risk management which entails a first stage of mapping.<br><br>One example among many is the European Flood Directive (EFD) sets out the requirement for the Member States to develop flood mapping comprising of flood hazard maps and flood risk maps. Flood hazard maps cover the geographical areas which could be flooded according to the following scenarios:<br><br>a) floods with a low probability, or extreme event scenarios;<br><br>b) floods with a medium probability (likely return period ≥ 100 years);<br><br>c) floods with a high probability, where appropriate.<br><br>For each scenario the following elements must be shown:<br><br>a) the flood extent;<br><br>b) water depths or water level, as appropriate;<br><br>c) where appropriate, the flow velocity or the relevant water flow.<br><br>In case data were not available or deemed of insufficient accuracy is always possible to perform studies for a specific location using established methodologies or use historical series to derive extent and intensities of specific hazards.<br><br><b>Element at risk</b><br><br>The GIS Platform is focused on European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) hence infrastructures which are of the highest importance for the Community and which if disrupted or destroyed would affect two or more MS, or a single Member State if the critical infrastructure is located in another Member State. <br><br>This includes transboundary effects resulting from interdependencies between interconnected infrastructures across various sectors. <br><br>The procedure for the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures (ECI), and a has a common approach to the assessment of the needs to improve the protection of such infrastructures will be established by means of a Directive.<br><br>In any case models developed within the GIS Platform for ECI can transparently be reused for managing National Critical Infrastructures (NCI) whose management falls on the NCI owners/operators and on the Member States. <br><br>Following one of the key principles of the EPCIP the infrastructures the approach for selecting the infrastructures is sector-by-sector based because it would be impossible the collect in one singular place all the necessary experience, expertise and requirements of any sector involved in critical infrastructure protections.<br>Vulnerability Assessment<br><br>Vulnerability can be expressed in many different manners but in the realm of spatial analysis, vulnerability is the result of the overlay between the two previous elements, hazard and elements at risk. <br><br><br><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DwlFH848OEE/VbCSHQHdxvI/AAAAAAAABmc/Ylsiij7gaqM/s1600/image039.png"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DwlFH848OEE/VbCSHQHdxvI/AAAAAAAABmc/Ylsiij7gaqM/s320/image039.png"></a><br><br><a href="https://www.blogger.com/null">Figure </a>26 - Vulnerability Assessment<br><br>Here we want to estimate only physical vulnerability and no calculations are executed to assess social, economic or environmental vulnerability.

The basic method used is the application of damage-state curves, also called loss functions or vulnerability curves (Smith, 1994).<br><br>The inventory of infrastructures containing information of the construction technologies and value of each infrastructure is used in combination with various hazard maps for different return periods to generate vulnerability maps for a specific area.<br><br>Because the GIS Platform is intended as a tool that can support experts in planning risk mitigation policies we favor methods that use indicators for vulnerability and are based on expert opinion.<br><br>The methodology is still under development but is based on the approaches that can be found in the definition within the disaster risk framework by Davidson (1997), the triangle of risk of Villagrán de Lèon (2004) and the UN/ISDR framework for risk reduction (2004).
